## Short Description ## 
Firstly, we downloaded all the required files from Kaggle. Then we removed the text based columns and imported the features in our python code file. We gathered the algorithms that we wanted to apply from Scikit and applied the algorithm on our data file. Afterwards, we ran our program on Test.csv that we downloaded from Kaggle and submitted the results on Kaggle. 

## Findings ##  

**Finding 1: Various accuracy rates**  
The first insight that we gained was that, upon running our test data on different algorithms and models we got varying accuracy rates. This surprised us, becuase we thought that changing the algorithms will not affect the result that much.  

**Finding 2: Deep impact of sklearn and Naive Bayes**  
We did not think that implementing sklearn or multinomial Naive Bayes is important to get the desired results with high accuracy, so we first made our submissions without using sklearn or NB. The results that we got were undesirable and the accuracy rates were also not very appealing. Thus, we used sklearn and multiomial NB on the data and there was a noticable improvement in the results and we got an important insight that applying algorithms on data is really important.  

**Insight 3: Competition**  
Honestly, before this assignment we had no idea what Kaggle was. This assignment opened a whole new world to us of online programming competitions. We got really excited to see that there are so many competitions on the website that we never heard of before.
